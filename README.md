# How to Use "Do I Need an Umbrella?"

1. **Install the 'requests' Module**:
   Make sure you have the 'requests' module installed. If not, you can install it using pip or conda:

   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```

   or 

   ```sh
   conda install requests
   ```

2. **Get an API Key from OpenWeather**:
   You'll need an API key from OpenWeather to use this app. Replace 'your_api_key' in the script with your actual API key. You can get an API key by signing up at [OpenWeather API Keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).

3. **Optional: Change the City**:
   If you don't live in New York City, you can change the city variable in the script from 'New York' to your city.

4. **Running the Script**:
   The app will prompt you to enter the time until which you will be out. Based on the current weather forecast, it will tell you whether you need to bring an umbrella.
